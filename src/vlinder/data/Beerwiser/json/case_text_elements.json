            "value":"Like other brewers, Beerwiser uses a significant amount of water during the heating process and for cleaning bottles and kegs. On average, Beerwiser uses five pints of water to produce one pint of beer. In comparison, competitors such as Heineken and Carlsberg used 4.8 and 3.3 pints of water per pint of beer, respectively, in 2012 (Appleyard, n.d.).\n\nAdditionally, injuries among brewery workers reported to the Bureau of Labor Statistics have been increasing, rising from 160 in 2011 to 530 in 2014 (Roth, 2016). This issue is also present at our brewery.\n\nThe strategic challenge we face is determining which investments will lead to a more sustainable brewing process. We aim to create transparency for our key stakeholders regarding the potential value to our organization from reducing water consumption and workplace accidents."
