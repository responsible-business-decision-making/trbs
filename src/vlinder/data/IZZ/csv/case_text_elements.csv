Serving employees in hospitals, nursing and care homes, home care, handicapped care, mental health, and youth care, IZZ leverages its extensive knowledge and commitment to the care sector to provide healthcare insurance on a non-profit basis. This insurance, tailored to the unique needs and specific health risks of healthcare workers, covers nearly half a million Dutch healthcare employees and their families.

As a market leader, IZZ stands out by incorporating the input and influence of both employers and employees in the healthcare sector to shape the terms and conditions of their health insurance. This case illustrates how IZZ offers healthcare institutions objective insights to determine the optimal strategy for the People pillar, with a particular focus on employee employability.

Through its strategic decision-making process, IZZ supports numerous healthcare institutions in identifying measures that make healthcare a more pleasant, efficient, and attractive working environment."
