This case focuses on a (fictional) beer brewer that is interested in comparing the effects of
reducing water use and the amount of workplace accidents. 

### Refugees
The Refugee Accommodation Model helps policy-makers evaluate and make well-considered policy choices 
about incoming refugees. It:

- is a calculation model based on multidisciplinary research - helps to eliminate sentiment from a 
sensitive topic and provide insights based on empirical evidence.
- can be beneficial for any policy maker involved in the refugee-related policies
- assesses the impact of various policy instruments (e.g. language courses for refugees) on the desired outcomes 
(e.g. increase in social cohesion and/or employment among refugees). 
- recognizes that not all outcomes carry the same value for different stakeholders, 
allowing the user to set strategic priorities, against which assessment is made.

### IZZ
This case demonstrates how IZZ offers healthcare institutions objective insights into what â€“for them- the optimal 
strategy is with regard to the People pillar, mainly focusing on the employability of their employees. 
There is a serious need for measures that will help achieve a balance between supply and demand in the healthcare 
sector but also to account for the welfare of personnel. IZZ uses the strategic decision making process to support 
many healthcare institutions in finding out what measures will help make healthcare a more pleasant, efficient and 
attractive working environment.
