### Refugees
The Refugee Accommodation Model helps policy-makers evaluate and make well-considered policy choices 
about incoming refugees. It:

- is a calculation model based on multidisciplinary research - helps to eliminate sentiment from a 
sensitive topic and provide insights based on empirical evidence.
- can be beneficial for any policy maker involved in the refugee-related policies
- assesses the impact of various policy instruments (e.g. language courses for refugees) on the desired outcomes 
(e.g. increase in social cohesion and/or employment among refugees). 
- recognizes that not all outcomes carry the same value for different stakeholders, 
allowing the user to set strategic priorities, against which assessment is made.
